# Gradient-Generator
A very educating project in css manipulation and some cool concepts with JS and html.

# Some problems I faced when doing this project:

-wasnt familiar with linear-gradients, so this was a good project to get used to.

-Had problems with applying an active "button", ended up using a reset feature(set all active buttons to inactive) before setting the clicked button as active


# Things I learned:

-I was able to better understand many ways to manipulate css of objects through user input(really cool and gives ideas for other cool projects)

-better CSS design and html structuring, as well as the usage of an onclick function to define the current button("this")



# Current edits I have in mind/will execute:

-The current direction is set to "to bottom", I think for better usability, I should set a null value for currentDirection and then add a boolean for the scenario:  "The user generates the gradient without selecting a button' and return an alert and return "", to close out of function.

-I need to edit the css to allow better design for mobile and other devices with different viewport dimensions.
