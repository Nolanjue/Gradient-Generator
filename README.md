# Gradient-Generator
A very educating project in css manipulation and some cool concepts with JS and html.

# Some problems I faced when doing this project:

-wasnt familiar with linear-gradients, so this was a good project to get used to.
-Had problems with applying an active "button", ended up using a reset feature(set all active buttons to inactive) before setting the clicked button as active
